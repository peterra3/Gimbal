# Gimbal
Controllable object-detecting gimbal that spans 180 degrees in order to log the
distance between any detected object and its width. Project consists of using STM32 micro-controllers, breadboards
(custom PCB design on hand), joysticks, buffers, servo motors, and a US-100 sensor. Programmed using C and ADC
communication channels
